# Hey 👋

I've spent most of my professional life in venture capital and tech communications. I was an amateur coder before, and with AI, I became one again. Just tinkering here.

## A few projects

- 📖 [Readr](https://github.com/ymolodtsov/readr), a Safari-like Reading mode for Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers
- 🌁 [Photowall](https://github.com/ymolodtsov/photowall), a clean and minimal Hugo theme for photographers with a unified masonry feed
- 📝 [Flow](https://flow.molodtsov.me/), a minimal one-page note available in your browser and saving to local storage

💬 Ask me about running communications and promoting tech projects.
